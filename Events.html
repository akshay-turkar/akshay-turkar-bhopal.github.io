      <p>Today it is like through ‘Abhivyakti Garba Mahotsav’ Navratri dance festival has gone global. People from Bhopal, Indore and Jaipur wait for complete year for this festival. Abhivyakti Garba Mahotsav is a community in itself wherein people are connected since last 19 years and this community is increasing in size every year. Abhivyakti has seen young girls getting married becoming mothers and coming back to the same event with their children. Its actually overwhelming to see the kind of relatedness it has created in all the 3 centers Bhopal, Indore & Jaipur.

      From group’s perspective , there is an spiritual angle to the whole event. This event is really close to the heart of the DB group. Money earned from Abhivyakti is used for charity reasons. Religious ceremony is personally done by Mrs Jyoti Agarwal daily including the prayers offered to  5 statues of Ganpati across the Abhivyakti ground. Passion and love involved in organising this show is the main reason behind its huge success. It’s surprising but true that Abhivyakti Garba Mahotsav has same team of Decorators, Sound System, Tent, Stage Artist, DJ and trainers since last 19 years</p>
